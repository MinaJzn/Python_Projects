```

## Example
```bash
--- Contact Book Application ---
1. Add contact
2. Delete contact
3. Edit contact
4. View contacts
5. Quit

Please choose an option: 1

Enter Contact name: Alice
Enter Contact phone: 123456789
```

## Notes
- The phone number should be entered as a string (e.g., '123456789') to avoid any formatting issues.
- This is a simple, in-memory implementation. Closing the app will erase all contacts.
- Contacts are stored based on their unique ID and can be deleted or edited accordingly.
