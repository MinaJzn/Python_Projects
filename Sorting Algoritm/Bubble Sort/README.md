# Bubble Sort Algorithm
This script implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.
The function takes a list as input and returns a new sorted list.

## How It Works
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are out of order.
This process continues until the entire list is sorted.
## Project Structure
```
Bubble Sort/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Bubble.py - The main game class
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md - This file
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.1+
## Running the Project

1. Navigate to the `src` directory.
2. Run the `Bubble.py` file using Python.

```bash
cd src
python Bubble.py
```
## Example Usage
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(bubble_sorting([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1]))
```
**Output:**
```python
[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
