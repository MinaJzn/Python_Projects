# Selection Sort 
This is a simple Python implementation of the **Selection Sort** algorithm.
## Description
The `selection_sorting` function takes a list of numbers and sorts it in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm. This is a basic sorting technique that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and puts it at the beginning.
## Project Structure
```
Selection Sort/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Selection.py - The main game class
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md - This file
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.1+
## Running the Project

1. Navigate to the `src` directory.
2. Run the `Selection.py` file using Python.

```bash
cd src
python Selection.py
```
## Example Usage
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(selection_sorting([5, 1, 45, 12, 3]))
```
**Output:**
```python
[1, 3, 5, 12, 45]
```
