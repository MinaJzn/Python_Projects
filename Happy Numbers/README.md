# Happy Number
In this python project, you'll be diving into the world of "happy" numbers. A number is considered "happy" if by following a specific sequence, it results in 1. The sequence is as follows: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. These numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

For example, 19 is a happy number. Here's why:

- 1Â² + 9Â² = 82
- 8Â² + 2Â² = 68
- 6Â² + 8Â² = 100
- 1Â² + 0Â² + 0Â² = 1

As you can see, we eventually reached 1, which makes 19 a "happy" number. This project tasks you with creating a program that can accurately determine whether any given positive integer is a happy number or not.
